Rafute (Okinawan braised pork belly)


Image
rafute2.jpg


  

Ingredients
3
	lbs
	Pork belly, boneless, skin on
	6
	cups
	water
	3
	cups
	Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) or Hondashi soup stock
	1.5
	cups
	awamori(okinawan distilled liquor, substitute with sake or vodka)
	0.75
	cups
	Black sugar(substitute with muscovado sugar)
	1/2
	cup
	Soy sauce (8 tbsp, divided)
	1.5
	knob
	ginger
	



Directions
1. Wash the pork belly.
2. Place the pork belly in a large pot and add cold water. Bring to a boil and boil for 1 minute, then discard the water.
3. Rinse off any scum and foam from the pork, rinse the pot, and place the pork belly back in the pot. Fill it with cold water.
4. Bring the pot to a boil, skim off any scum and foam, and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the pork uncovered for at least 1 to 1.5 hours. Add boiling water as needed to keep the pork fully covered.
5. In a separate smaller pot, boil 4 cups of water. Add katsuobushi and let it simmer for 15 seconds. Turn off the heat and let the katsuobushi seep in the pot. Alternatively, you can use Hondashi soup stock to make the broth.
6. Slice the ginger and cut it into thin strips. Soak them in water for 10-15 minutes to remove some spiciness. Drain well and set aside for garnishing later.
7. After 1 to 1.5 hours of cooking the pork belly, transfer it to a plate and cover it with foil. Let it cool for about 5 minutes before slicing.
8. Once the pork belly is cool enough to handle, slice it to the desired thickness and add it back to the pot.
9. Strain the katsuobushi dashi into the pot with the pork belly.
10. Add awamori, black sugar, and soy sauce to the pot, mixing the liquid to make sure the pork belly is fully covered with the sauce.
11. Bring the pot to a gentle simmer, skim off any foam, and cover with a lid. Cook over medium-low heat for 2 hours, or until the pork is very tender and the skin/fat is gelatinous.
12. Serve the pork belly on a plate and pour some of the braising liquid over it. Garnish with the ginger slices.

5. Once the bread is done, carefully remove it from the bread machine and transfer it to a wire rack to cool.
6. Slice and enjoy your freshly baked French bread with your favorite toppings and spreads.

Avocado Toast

no_picture_yet.jpg




Ingredients
1
	

	avocado
	1
	tsp
	Lemon juice
	1/4
	tsp
	Salt 
	1/4
	tsp
	Black pepper
	1
	clove
	Garlic, chopped
	2
	slices
	bread
	1
	tsp
	Olive oil
	1
	pinch
	Red pepper flakes
	1
	tsp
	Balsamic vinegar
	6
	

	Cherry tomatoes, chopped
	

Directions                        
1. Cut the avocado in half and remove the pit. Scoop out the flesh with a spoon and place it in a medium-sized mixing bowl.
2. Add the chopped garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to the mixing bowl with the avocado. Use a fork to mash the ingredients together until they form a smooth paste. You want to make sure that there are no large chunks of avocado left.
3. Toast the slices of bread in a toaster or in the oven until they're golden brown. If using an oven, preheat it to 375°F (190°C) and place the bread directly on the oven rack. Toast for 5-7 minutes, or until the bread is crispy and golden brown.
4. Spread the avocado mixture evenly on each slice of bread. Use a butter knife or the back of a spoon to spread the mixture from edge to edge, making sure that the bread is evenly covered.
5. Drizzle the olive oil over the avocado spread on each slice of bread. This will help to keep the toast moist and add some extra flavor.
6. Top each slice of bread with the chopped tomatoes and sprinkle the red pepper flakes over the top. This will add some color and texture to the toast, as well as a little bit of heat from the red pepper flakes.
7. Toast the bread again in the oven for a few minutes until the tomatoes are slightly roasted. This step is optional, but it can help to enhance the flavor of the tomatoes and make them slightly sweeter.
8. Remove the bread from the oven and sprinkle balsamic vinegar over the top of each slice. This will add a tangy flavor and some acidity to the dish.
9. Serve the toast hot and enjoy! This recipe is perfect for breakfast, lunch, or a light dinner, and can be served on its own or with a side salad.

Ingredients
2
	bunches
	broccolini
	1
	Tbsp
	Olive oil
	4
	cloves
	Garlic, thinly sliced
	1
	tsp
	salt
	1/2
	tsp
	Red pepper flakes
	1/2
	cup
	water
	-
	

	Lemon wedges
	



Directions


1. Start by preparing the broccolini. Rinse the broccolini under cool water and shake off any excess water. Then, using a sharp knife, trim about ½ inch off the bottom of the stems. This will ensure that the broccolini cooks evenly.
2. Heat up a large skillet over medium-high heat until the oil is shimmering. You want the pan to be hot so that the broccolini cooks quickly and develops a nice char. Once the pan is hot, add the broccolini to the skillet and sauté for 5-7 minutes, or until the broccolini is bright green and some stems and tops of the florets are lightly charred.
3. Add the garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes to the skillet. Stir the ingredients together and continue to sauté until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Be careful not to let the garlic burn, as this can give your dish a bitter taste.
4. Pour in the water and quickly cover the skillet with a lid. Cook until the broccolini is vibrant green and crisp-tender, which should take about 1 to 2 minutes. The water will help steam the broccolini and make it tender.
5. Once the broccolini is cooked to your liking, remove the skillet from the heat. Serve immediately with lemon wedges on the side. The lemon wedges add a fresh and bright flavor to the dish, which complements the earthy flavor of the broccolini.

French Green Beans with Butter Sauce and Crispy Leeks

Ingredients
1/2
	cup
	flour
	1/2
	tsp
	salt
	1/2
	tsp
	Ground pepper
	1/2
	cup
	buttermilk
	2
	tbsp
	Leeks, chopped
	1/2
	cup
	White wine
	3
	tbsp
	vinegar
	2
	tbsp
	Celery, chopped
	1
	tsp
	sugar
	10
	tbsp
	Unsalted butter
	1.5
	lb
	Haricots verts
	



Directions




1. Begin by heating 1 inch of oil in a heavy pot over medium heat until it reaches a temperature of 350F. It's important to use a heavy pot to ensure even heat distribution and to prevent the pot from tipping over due to the weight of the oil.
2. While the oil is heating, prepare the leeks by cutting them into rounds and washing them thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, ¼ tsp salt, and pepper. This will create a seasoned flour mixture that will coat the leeks and help them develop a crispy exterior.
3. In another bowl, pour some buttermilk. The acidity in the buttermilk will help tenderize the leeks and also create a creamy texture when combined with the flour coating. Dip the leek rounds in the buttermilk, then dredge them in the seasoned flour mixture until they are fully coated.
4. Once the oil has reached 350F, carefully add the coated leeks to the pot, being sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry the leeks until they are golden and crispy, which should take about 1 minute. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove the leeks from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
5. Now it's time to prepare the butter sauce. In a separate pot over medium heat, combine the white wine, vinegar, celery, chopped leeks, remaining ¼ tsp salt and pepper, and sugar. This will create a flavorful base for the sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil and allow it to cook until the liquid is reduced by two-thirds. This will help concentrate the flavors and create a thicker sauce.
6. Once the liquid has reduced, whisk in the butter until it's fully incorporated into the sauce. This will create a rich, velvety texture that will complement the crispiness of the leeks and the freshness of the green beans.
7. To assemble the dish, transfer the steamed green beans to a platter. Drizzle the butter sauce over the green beans, making sure to coat them evenly. Finally, top the green beans with the fried leeks, which will add a delicious crunch and a savory flavor.

	4
	oz
	Parmesan, grated
	3.5
	lbs
	Yukon gold potatoes, sliced ¼ inch thick
	



Directions


1. Preheat your oven to 350F to ensure that it's hot and ready to go when you need it.
2. Lightly grease a 3 quart baking dish to ensure that the potato gratin doesn't stick to the sides or bottom of the dish during baking. You can use a non-stick spray or butter to grease the dish.
3. In a large bowl, combine the onions, cream, garlic, thyme, rosemary, 1 ⅔ cups of Gruyere cheese, and ⅔ cup of parmesan cheese. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. This step is important to make sure that all the ingredients are evenly distributed and that the flavors are well-balanced.
4. Take your potato slices and arrange them vertically in the prepared baking dish. This will help to create a visually pleasing presentation and ensure that the potatoes are cooked evenly. It's important to slice the potatoes thinly so that they cook through and are tender.
5. Pour the cream mixture over the potatoes, making sure that some of the mixture goes between the potatoes. This will help to ensure that every potato slice is coated in the creamy, cheesy mixture, resulting in a rich and flavorful dish.
6. Cover the dish with aluminum foil to prevent the potatoes from drying out while baking. This step is important to make sure that the potatoes cook through evenly and are not overcooked on the edges.
7. Bake the potato gratin in the preheated oven until the potatoes start to soften, which should take about 50-60 minutes. This step is important to make sure that the potatoes are cooked through and tender before the cheese on top is browned.
8. Remove the foil and bake the gratin until the potatoes are golden brown, which should take another 25-30 minutes. This step is important to create a crispy and golden-brown crust on top of the potato gratin.
9. Sprinkle the remaining ⅓ cup of Gruyere and ⅓ cup of parmesan cheese over the top of the gratin. This will add an extra layer of flavor and texture to the dish.
10. Bake the potato gratin for an additional 5-10 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly. This step is important to create a perfectly melted and browned cheese topping on the dish.
You'll have a delicious and impressive potato gratin that's perfect for any occasion. Enjoy!

Ingredients
0.5
	lb
	Fresh mushrooms, quartered
	3
	cloves
	Garlic, sliced
	1
	tbsp
	Olive oil
	1
	tsp
	Worcestershire sauce
	1
	tsp 
	Balsamic vinegar
	1/2
	tsp
	Dried oregano
	1/8
	tsp
	salt
	1/8 
	tsp
	Black pepper
	1
	tbsp 
	Fresh parsley
	



Directions


1. Preheat the oven to 400F.
2. Clean the mushrooms and cut them into large pieces. You can use any type of mushroom you like, such as portobello, shiitake, or button mushrooms. Place the mushrooms in a baking pan that is large enough to hold them in a single layer. Make sure the pan is lightly oiled so that the mushrooms do not stick.
3. Stir in the minced garlic to the mushrooms. Garlic adds a rich and savory flavor to the dish that complements the mushrooms well.
4. Drizzle oil, Worcestershire sauce, and balsamic vinegar over the mushrooms. The oil helps to keep the mushrooms moist during roasting, while the Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar add depth of flavor and a tangy sweetness to the dish.
5. Sprinkle oregano, salt, and pepper over the mushrooms. The oregano adds a warm, earthy flavor, while the salt and pepper help to bring out the natural flavors of the mushrooms.
6. Toss the mushrooms with the other ingredients until they are evenly coated. You can use your hands or a spoon to mix the ingredients together.
7. Roast the mushrooms in the preheated oven, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes or until tender, stirring twice during the cooking process. Roasting the mushrooms in the oven allows them to develop a rich, nutty flavor and caramelized edges. Stirring the mushrooms twice during cooking helps to ensure they cook evenly.
8. Remove the mushrooms from the oven and stir in the fresh parsley. The parsley adds a bright, fresh flavor to the dish and also provides a pop of green color.
9. You can serve the roasted mushrooms as a side dish, or use them to add flavor to other dishes, such as pasta or rice dishes. Enjoy!

Makes 1-⅓ cups. 


Lasts 3-4 days.


Ingredients
1/2
	cup
	Sour cream
	1/2
	cup
	buttermilk
	1/4
	cup
	mayo
	2
	

	Garlic cloves, minced
	1
	tsp
	salt
	1/4
	tsp
	pepper
	1-1/2
	tsp
	Dried dill
	1/4
	cup
	Finely chopped fresh chives
	2
	tsp
	 Fresh lemon juice
	0
	dashes
	tabasco
	

Directions
* When combining the ingredients, it can be helpful to use a whisk or a fork to mix everything together until well combined.
* You can adjust the seasoning to taste. If you like your dip more garlicky, feel free to add more minced garlic. If you like a spicier dip, you can add more tabasco sauce.
* After whisking everything together, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and place it in the fridge to chill. This allows the flavors to meld together and also firms up the dip slightly.
* This recipe yields about 1-⅓ cups of dip. If you need more, you can easily double or triple the recipe.
* The dip can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days. If the dip separates a bit after sitting, simply give it a good stir before serving.
