Peel and cut the potatoes in quarters. In a large pot, put water and potatoes, and bring them to a boil. Cook potatoes until a skewer goes through the potato easily, about 15-20 minutes. Drain.\n 2. Move the pot back to the stove. On low heat, shake the pot so that the remaining moisture will completely evaporate (but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t burn them).\n 3. Turn off the heat and mash the potatoes. Unlike the typical mashed potatoes, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to mash them completely. I like leaving some small chunks for texture. Set aside.\n 4. Meanwhile, chop onion, carrot, and mushrooms finely.\n 5. In a large skillet, heat oil on medium-high heat. Saut\u00c3\u00a9 onion until soft.\n 6. Add carrot and shiitake mushrooms and cook until they are soft.\n 7. Add the meat and break it up with a wooden spoon. When the meat is cooked through, add salt, white pepper, and black pepper. Remove from the heat.\n 8. Add the meat mixture to the mashed potatoes in the large pot, leaving the cooking liquid behind as we don't want to introduce too much moisture to the mixture.\n 9. Add an egg. Mix it all together until everything is well combined.\n 10. While the mixture is still warm, but not hot, start shaping the mixture into Korokke patties. Cover and let the Korokke patties rest in the fridge for 30 minutes (Do not skip!). TIP: Resting and cooling down the patties prevents the croquettes from exploding while deep frying. The cold patties in the hot oil will not release any steam; therefore, croquettes will not explode in the oil. If you skip this process and the patties are still warm, the temperature of the patties will go up and start to steam, which will then puncture a hole in the panko coating and explode. It also helps the ingredients to meld together.\n To Bread the Korokke\n After 30 minutes, coat each patty with flour, egg, and panko, in that order.\n Cover with plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n To Deep Fry\n Deep fry Korokke until they are golden brown. The inside is already cooked, so all you need to do is to fry them until nicely brown.\n Transfer Korokke to paper towels and let the oil be absorbed in the paper. Serve immediately with Tonkatsu Sauce.\n To Store\n You can store the leftover in an airtight container and freeze up to a month. To reheat, put frozen or half defrosted korokke on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper and bake at 350\u00c2\u00baF (180\u00c2\u00baC) for 15 minutes or until inside is warm.\n", "ingredients": ["2 lb Russet potatoes (about 4 potatoes)", "1 onion", "1/2 carrot", "2 Shiitake mushrooms", "2 Tbsp oil", "1 lb Ground beef", "1 large Egg (50g w/o shell)", "1 tsp salt", "1/4 tsp White pepper powder", "0 Black pepper", "1/2 cup All-purpose flour", "3 large eggs", "2 cups panko", "0 Tonkatsu sauce (for serving)"]}, "7": {"id": 7, "categories": ["Dinner", "Meats"], "name": "Butter Chicken", "image": "no_picture_yet.jpg", "instructions": "1.

Begin by heating 1 inch of oil in a heavy pot over medium heat until it reaches a temperature of 350F. It's important to use a heavy pot to ensure even heat distribution and to prevent the pot from tipping over due to the weight of the oil.\n 2. While the oil is heating, prepare the leeks by cutting them into rounds and washing them thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, \u00c2\u00bc tsp salt, and pepper. This will create a seasoned flour mixture that will coat the leeks and help them develop a crispy exterior.\n 3. In another bowl, pour some buttermilk. The acidity in the buttermilk will help tenderize the leeks and also create a creamy texture when combined with the flour coating. Dip the leek rounds in the buttermilk, then dredge them in the seasoned flour mixture until they are fully coated.\n 4. Once the oil has reached 350F, carefully add the coated leeks to the pot, being sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry the leeks until they are golden and crispy, which should take about 1 minute. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove the leeks from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.\n 5. Now it's time to prepare the butter sauce. In a separate pot over medium heat, combine the white wine, vinegar, celery, chopped leeks, remaining \u00c2\u00bc tsp salt and pepper, and sugar. This will create a flavorful base for the sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil and allow it to cook until the liquid is reduced by two-thirds. This will help concentrate the flavors and create a thicker sauce.\n 6. Once the liquid has reduced, whisk in the butter until it's fully incorporated into the sauce. This will create a rich, velvety texture that will complement the crispiness of the leeks and the freshness of the green beans.\n 7. To assemble the dish, transfer the steamed green beans to a platter. Drizzle the butter sauce over the green beans, making sure to coat them evenly. Finally, top the green beans with the fried leeks, which will add a delicious crunch and a savory flavor.\n", "ingredients": ["1/2 cup flour", "1/2 tsp salt", "1/2 tsp Ground pepper", "1/2 cup buttermilk", "2 tbsp Leeks, chopped", "1/2 cup White wine", "3 tbsp vinegar", "2 tbsp Celery, chopped", "1 tsp sugar", "10 tbsp Unsalted butter", "1.5 lb Haricots verts"]}, "41": {"id": 41, "categories": ["Sides"], "name": "Hasselback Potato Gratin", "image": "no_picture_yet.jpg", "instructions": "1.
