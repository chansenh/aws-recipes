Begin by heating 1 inch of oil in a heavy pot over medium heat until it reaches a temperature of 350F. It's important to use a heavy pot to ensure even heat distribution and to prevent the pot from tipping over due to the weight of the oil.\n 2. While the oil is heating, prepare the leeks by cutting them into rounds and washing them thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, \u00c2\u00bc tsp salt, and pepper. This will create a seasoned flour mixture that will coat the leeks and help them develop a crispy exterior.\n 3. In another bowl, pour some buttermilk. The acidity in the buttermilk will help tenderize the leeks and also create a creamy texture when combined with the flour coating. Dip the leek rounds in the buttermilk, then dredge them in the seasoned flour mixture until they are fully coated.\n 4. Once the oil has reached 350F, carefully add the coated leeks to the pot, being sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry the leeks until they are golden and crispy, which should take about 1 minute. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove the leeks from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.\n 5. Now it's time to prepare the butter sauce. In a separate pot over medium heat, combine the white wine, vinegar, celery, chopped leeks, remaining \u00c2\u00bc tsp salt and pepper, and sugar. This will create a flavorful base for the sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil and allow it to cook until the liquid is reduced by two-thirds. This will help concentrate the flavors and create a thicker sauce.\n 6. Once the liquid has reduced, whisk in the butter until it's fully incorporated into the sauce. This will create a rich, velvety texture that will complement the crispiness of the leeks and the freshness of the green beans.\n 7.
